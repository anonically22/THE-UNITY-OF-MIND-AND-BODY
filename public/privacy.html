                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Welcome to The Unity of Mind and Body platform. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you visit our website and use our services.</p>

                <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
                <p>We may collect personal information such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Name, email address, and contact details when you register or use our contact/feedback forms.</li>
                    <li>Information related to your session bookings (e.g., type of session, date, time).</li>
                    <li>Any other information you voluntarily provide to us.</li>
                    <li>Usage data (e.g., pages visited, time spent on site) collected automatically through cookies or similar technologies (Placeholder for future implementation).</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>
                <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Provide, operate, and maintain our platform and services.</li>
                    <li>Process your session bookings and manage your account.</li>
                    <li>Respond to your comments, questions, and feedback.</li>
                    <li>Send you updates, and other administrative messages.</li>
                    <li>Improve our website, services, and user experience.</li>
                    <li>Monitor and analyze trends, usage, and activities in connection with our services.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Disclosure of Your Information</h3>

                <ul>

                    <li>To trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential (e.g., future integration with licensed therapists who would have their own confidentiality agreements).</li>
                    <li>To comply with legal obligations.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em>(This is a very basic placeholder. A real privacy policy would be much more detailed and legally reviewed.)</em></p>

                <h3>Security of Your Information</h3>
                <p>We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information.
